## personal experience about Security+ preparation and final exam

Hi,

I'm happy to share the materials I used to prepare for the exam. It took me about five months of dedicated preparation, with the final stretch being especially intense. During that period, I installed a paid app on my phone to practice with numerous exercises.

Be cautious when looking for study materials onlineâ€”there's an overwhelming amount of content, and much of it is unnecessary for the exam. This can easily lead to wasting valuable time and causing confusion.

The 90 exam questions are not overly difficult, but the real challenge lies in consistent practice. I noticed that, after getting through about half of the questions, fatigue began to set in, and it became easier to make mistakes. It's crucial to review the questions thoroughly, but also to practice a lot to build your stamina and avoid errors during the actual exam.

Good luck!

Jack
